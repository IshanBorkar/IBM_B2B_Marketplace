Text classification:
1. User-Manual: OCR type pdf. Images are more in this document.
2. Manufacturer-Brochure: OCR type pdf. Images are more in this document.
3. Additional-pdf1: Editable type PDF
4. Additional-pdf2: Editable type PDF
5. Additional-pdf3: Editable type PDF. Data is in Tabular format.
6. Additional-pdf4: OCR type pdf. Some data is in Tabular format.
7. Additional-pdf5: OCR type pdf. Data is in the form of images, diagrams, graphs, tables.
8. Additional-pdf6: OCR type pdf.
9. Additional-pdf7: OCR type pdf. The text, images are in the form of Powerpoint presentation.
10. Additional-pdf8: OCR type pdf. The text, images are in the form of Powerpoint presentation.
11. Additional-pdf9: OCR type pdf. The text, images are in the form of Powerpoint presentation.

Input to the model: For text classification models like logistic regression, naive bayes, universal sentence encoder, bert we can consider User-Manual and Manufacturer-Brochure as the input since more amount of text is present in the PDF.
Other documents like Additional-Pdfs4 to 9 will be useful for LSTM models since large amount of OCR data is present in it.
